# Scrypto Advent Calendar
I am publishing new Christmas related Scrypto examples every day from Dec 1st to Dec 25th.

"Watch" this project to get notified when I push my daily examples !

## Learning Scrypto
The examples I publish will become more and more difficult as we approach the 25th. If you ever feel like you don't understand, you can ask me questions on the [Scrypto discord chanel](https://discord.gg/radixdlt), my username is @cbisaillon.

You can also read the [Scrypto tutorial](https://www.scrypto-tutorial.com/) I wrote with Rock Howard

## How to run the examples

1. Follow [this guide](https://www.scrypto-tutorial.com/getting-started/installation) to install the scrypto simulator
1. Enter one of the example directories: `cd day1`
1. Follow the instructions in the README.md for that particular example
